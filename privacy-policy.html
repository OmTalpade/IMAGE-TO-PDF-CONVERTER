          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how the Image to PDF Converter
            (referred to as “we”, “our”, or “the service”) handles information
            when you use our online IMAGE TO PDF CONVERTER. We are committed to
            respecting your privacy and ensuring that you clearly understand how
            your data is processed when you interact with our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Image to PDF Converter, you agree to the
            terms described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with
            these terms, please discontinue use of the website. We may update
            this policy from time to time, and any significant changes will be
            reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Processing and Images</h2>
          <p>
            The core functionality of the IMAGE TO PDF CONVERTER relies on
            client-side processing. When you upload images to convert them into
            PDF files, the entire conversion process takes place within your web
            browser using JavaScript. Your images are not transmitted to our
            servers, nor are they stored or logged by us.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is designed to maximize privacy and minimize exposure
            of your files. Once you close or refresh the page, any temporary
            data related to the uploaded images is discarded from your browser
            session. We strongly recommend that you avoid uploading highly
            sensitive or confidential images on shared or public devices.
          </p>

          <h2>Log Data and Usage Information</h2>
          <p>
            Like many websites, basic technical information may be collected
            automatically by standard web server logs or third-party analytics
            tools. This can include non-personal data such as browser type,
            operating system, referring URLs, general geographic location, and
            approximate usage duration. This information is used in aggregate
            form to understand how users interact with the site and to improve
            performance, compatibility, and usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not intentionally use this data to personally identify
            individual visitors. Any analytics involved are focused on
            improving the IMAGE TO PDF CONVERTER, diagnosing technical issues,
            and ensuring that the site functions correctly across different
            devices and environments.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
          <p>
            The Image to PDF Converter may use cookies or local storage for
            limited purposes. For example, we store your dark mode or light mode
            preference in local storage so that the website remembers your
            selected theme whenever you return. This small piece of data does
            not contain personally identifiable information and is only used to
            enhance your experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can manage or clear local storage and cookies through your
            browser settings at any time. Disabling these features may affect
            certain preferences or interactions but will not prevent you from
            using the core IMAGE TO PDF CONVERTER functionality.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            The website may rely on third-party resources such as content
            delivery networks (CDNs) to provide libraries or fonts necessary for
            the converter to function efficiently. These third parties may
            collect limited technical information as part of delivering their
            services, subject to their own privacy policies. We do not control
            how such providers manage their data, but we aim to select
            reputable services commonly used across the web.
          </p>

          <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Image to PDF Converter is intended for general audiences and is
            not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do
            not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
            believe that a child has provided personal data through the website,
            please contact us so we can take appropriate steps to remove such
            information.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in
            technology, legal requirements, or our practices. Any updates will
            be posted on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. We encourage
            you to review the policy regularly to remain informed about how your
            data is handled when using the IMAGE TO PDF CONVERTER.
          </p>

          <h2>Contact</h2>
